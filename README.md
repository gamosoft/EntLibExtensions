# Enterprise Library Extensions

Extensions for Enterprise Library 5 that include:
* SharePoint 2010 Logging Trace Listener.
* Cache Provider for Windows Server AppFabric.
* Disabled Cache Provider.

The usage of this tools assumes that you know how to install SharePoint packages, activate features, use Windows Server AppFabric caching, ... There are lots of tutorials out there, so please refer to them should you need any guidance. This is just a compilation of code to enhance these already amazing tools, which you can freely use and modify (please add a reference to this site if you do so) to suit your needs. It's not bullet-proof, so use at your own risk, but I've decided to upload it as-is so the community can check it out (since you also will have the source code).

Please read the migrated docs for more information until I have time to arrange the README.md file. :-)

You can download the compiled binaries here in the meantime:
